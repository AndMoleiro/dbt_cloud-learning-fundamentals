### Naming Conventions


- Sources: 
    - Raw data that has already been loaded

- Staging models: 
    - Clean and standardize the data
    - One to one with source tables

- Intermediate models:
    - Models between staging and final models
    - Always build on staging models

- Fact models
    - Things that are occuring or have occurred
        - Events, clicks, votes 

- Dimension models:
    - People, place or thing
        - Users, companies, products, customers
    - Things that won't change much, but can change a bit. Eg: email


### Sources

- Allow you to document raw tables and put them in a .yml file where you reference the database, schema and name.
- You can add aliases to point to those speciffic tables
- We then reference them by using the source function. Eg:
    - `{{ source('stripe', 'payments') }}`
- Sources will then show in your lineage

#### Source freshness

- We can use the command `source freshness`. To do it, we need to add to our yml file:
    - loaded_at_field
    - freshness block
