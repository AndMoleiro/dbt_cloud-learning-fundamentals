### Naming Conventions


- Sources: 
    - Raw data that has already been loaded

- Staging models: 
    - Clean and standardize the data
    - One to one with source tables

- Intermediate models:
    - Models between staging and final models
    - Always build on staging models

- Fact models
    - Things that are occuring or have occurred
        - Events, clicks, votes 

- Dimension models:
    - People, place or thing
        - Users, companies, products, customers
    - Things that won't change much, but can change a bit. Eg:           


### Sources

- Allow you to document raw tables and put them in a .yml file where you reference the database, schema and name.
- You can add aliases to point to those speciffic tables
- We then reference them by using the source function. Eg:
    - `{{ source('stripe', 'payments') }}`
- Sources will then show in your lineage

#### Source freshness

- We can use the command `source freshness`. To do it, we need to add to our yml file:
    - loaded_at_field
    - freshness block


### Testing

- Singular tests

    - Very speciffic
    - Applied to maybe one or two models
    - Assert something really speciffic about the logic of that speciffic models

- Generic tests
    - Scalable types of tests
        - `unique` - Asserts if every value in this column is unique
        - `not null` - Asserts if every value in this column is not null
        - `accepted_values` - Asserts that every value in the column exists in a pre-defined list
        - `relationships` - Asserts of every value in the column exists in the column of another table


### DBT Build command

- `dbt run`
    - Creates all the models in our warehouse, in dag order
- `dbt test`
    - Runs all the tests, in dag order
    - If a test fails, downstream models would already be created with problematic data

- `dbt build`
    - Combines all the commands, including `dbt run` and `dbt test`, in dag order
        - Tests Sources
        - If sources pass, run the first set of modules and tests those
        - If they pass, runs the next set of models
        - ...
    - If a test fails, the job will hault and no downstream model will be ran with problematic data


### Documentation

- We can document our models and sources by:
    - Adding a line of text by addin `descriprion` under `name` in the yml file
    - By creating a md file, adding code blocks and referencing those blocks in the yml file
        - Reference should be the block name, not the file name
